### Evaluate and compare bash and arduino ###
Arduino can be worked by a program and apply it to actual circuit.
Comparing to bash, bash is mainly used to create an app or system in computer whereas arduino is mainly used to create a product with circuit such as mobile battery and temprature sensor.
Both programs are basically easy for begginers but arduino requires circuit.
