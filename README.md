### Evaluate and compare bash and arduino ###
Arduino can be worked by a program and apply it to actual circuit.
Comparing to bash, bash is mainly used to create an app or system in computer whereas arduino is mainly used to create a product with circuit such as mobile battery and temprature sensor.
Both programs are basically easy for begginers but arduino requires circuit.

**11/11 Reflection**
Today basically I learned how to make a code in Arduino. For example, how to use "void" and set the valuable.
I felt bit difficult to code because Arduino is more focused on applying on real circuit. 

``` int redLED = 13;```
define valuable redLED as 13 in Arduino

**11/13 Reflection**
Today I made the system which counts binary with LEDs in groups and I learned how to use %
And also I learned how to convert decimal to binary, binary to decimal as homework.
